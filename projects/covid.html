                                <p>This project explores COVID-19 data in a dashboard created in Tableau.</p>
                                <p>The dashboard provides insights into the COVID-19 pandemic, by the number of infected cases and confirmed deaths over time. It also includes charts by country and continent to help understand the spread of the virus.</p>

                                    <h2>Dataset Exploration</h2>
                                    <p>The main data source is available at this <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths">website</a>. It provides daily and cumulative figures on COVID-19, including confirmed cases and deaths by country. The data used to create the dashboard was retrieved by running SQL queries on this dataset. You can check out my previous project with the SQL queries, of which this dashboard is a continuation, at this <a href="../projects/sql_data_exploration.html">link</a>.</p>
                                    <p>A dashboard has been created in Tableau to visualize key insights, including:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>global totals for infected cases, confirmed deaths, and death percentage,</li>
                                        <li>total deaths by continent,</li>
                                        <li>percentage of the population infected per country,</li>
                                        <li>percentage of the population infected over time by country.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </section>

                                    <h2>Insights</h2>
                                    <p>A few insights are mentioned below, though additional findings can be uncovered by changing the filters, as it is an interactive dashboard.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>European countries experienced the highest percentage of infections relative to their population and recorded the highest total deaths among all continents.</li>
                                        <li>Oceania (Australia and nearby regions) and Africa had the lowest infection rates relative to their population, along with the lowest total deaths as continents.</li>
                                        <li>The percentage of the population infected increased nonlinearly over time. Germany saw the highest increase, with the infection rate rising from 0% to 2.41% in the first year, and then jumping to 7.18% in the second year, demonstrating a sharp acceleration in the spread of infections.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>For detailed visualizations and further insights, please check out the dashboard on <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/fahmida.nahiyan/viz/COVIDDashboard_17058836971500/Dashboard1">Tableau</a>.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The data covers the period from 2020 to October 2021, so the insights reflect data only within this timeframe.</p>
