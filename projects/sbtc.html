                                <p>This project uses transformer-based techniques to classify scientific Bengali texts into their respective scientific domains. Also, performance of traditional ML and DL models are investigated on traditional and local contextual word embedding techniques.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        <p>Data was gathered from Bengali academic books, specifically those used for the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) exams conducted by the Intermediate and Secondary Education Boards of Bangladesh. The dataset is categorized into six classes: five scientific domains and one non-scientific domain. The classes are <strong>'Physics', 'Chemistry', 'Biology', 'Information and Communication Technology (ICT)', 'Mathematics', and 'Others'</strong>. Over a period of two months, 6000 texts were collected, with 1000 texts for each class.</p>
                                        <p>Annotation was primarily based on the subject matter of the source books. However, some texts had overlapping class boundaries. To address this, three annotators assigned labels to each data point, and the final label was determined by majority vote. An expert annotator then verified the final labels to create the definitive dataset. The average Kappa value for the dataset is 0.9928, indicating almost perfect agreement according to the kappa scale.</p>
                                        <p>You can find the dataset on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fahmidanahiyan/scientific-bengali-text-classification-dataset" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>.</p>
